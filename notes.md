# Telling Gazebo about models

`ln -s $HOME/Documents/projects/adabot/adabot04-gz/models/ugv ~/.gazebo/models/`

# From Brew after `brew install gazebo10`

==> numpy
If you use system python (that comes - depending on the OS X version -
with older versions of numpy, scipy and matplotlib), you may need to
ensure that the brewed packages come earlier in Python's sys.path with:
  mkdir -p /Users/ajc/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
  echo 'import sys; sys.path.insert(1, "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages")' >> /Users/ajc/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/homebrew.pth
